1) Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Loaded and explored the dataset containing various features of Californian districts.
Checked for missing values, handled them appropriately, and performed feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Visualization and Correlation Analysis:

2) Conducted exploratory data analysis with visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Outlier Detection and Removal:

3) Identified and removed outliers from the total_rooms feature using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation:

4) Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained three different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression).
Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
Single Variable Linear Regression:

5) Performed a simplified linear regression using only the median_income feature.
Analyzed and visualized the model's fit and performance on both the training and test sets.
